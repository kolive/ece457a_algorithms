To do TabuSearch, run the following commands:

>> load Units100.mat
>> TabuLength = 5;
>> NumIterations = 5;
>> [BestSoln, BestSolnCost] = TabuSearch(Graph, TabuLength, NumIterations, 'GenInitialST', 'GetBestNeighbourST');

TabuLength is the length of the Tabu list. Told in assignment to use 5, 10, 15, 25, 50
NumIterations is the maximum number of iterations. Not sure about this one, I just tried random numbers
