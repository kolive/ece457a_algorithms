Our AI plays tic tac toe using minimax with AB pruning where the heuristic is a
modified version of the one discussed in class - number of possible winning
moves remaining minus number of possible winning moves for opponent remaining.
It adds to that heuristic by giving winning moves extra score bonuses and losing
moves extra penalties.
