% investigation of new aco method
% tweak: scaling factor, beta, alpha, number of ants
% constant: number of iterations, granularity
% observe: rate of convergence, computation time, best answer found

% but first, is the pheromone update working properly? Yes.
% is the children generation working properly? Probably...
% is the path logging working properly? yes.

% so what are we going to write in the report?
% well, we implemented it a few times and both times it sucked
% look, we tried to pheremone update methods!
% both sucked!
