Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is one of the modern heuristic algorithms that can be applied to continuous and discrete optimization problems.
The original binary PSO (BPSO) has got some disadvantages that make the algorithm not to converge well.
To deal with these disadvantages, a new BPSO (NBPSO) is introduced. The results provided in the fallowing papers show the superiority of the NBPSO.
