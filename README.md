ECE457a - Co-operative and Adaptive Algorithms
==============================================

This repository is a collection of some of the algorithms learned abotu in ece457a. Note that these algorithms are not all commented, and may not all even work properly. 

I would ask that if you're taking the course or a similar course on the subject matter to only use my implementations as a reference, for two reasons. 

1. I can't speak for the integrity of all the implementations, as these are mostly off-the-cuff implementations to test my understanding 
2. Academic Integrity and stuff.

Otherwise, go crazy.
